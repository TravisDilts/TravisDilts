# Hi there, I'm Travis ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Travis, a software developer from Edmonton, Alberta. I've been around long enough to see many things succeed and many things fail, and I
love bringing that experience to the projects I work on. I've spent time in Software Development, Quality Assurance, and did a brief stint in Senior Management.
